# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive presentation about Python packaging and production best practices for software engineers. The content is designed to be universally applicable to any organization or individual learning modern Python packaging.

## Target Audiences

The content targets two main audiences commonly found in modern software teams:

- **Data Scientists/ML Engineers**: Strong Python skills but limited packaging knowledge
- **Backend Engineers**: Strong Java/software engineering practices but new to Python ecosystem

**Need**: Production-ready Python code that scales, maintains, and integrates well

**Core Theme**: The presentation focuses on **environment control as the fundamental driver of Python dependency management**. The goal is to help engineers understand how different Python tool types (libraries, frameworks, applications) control their execution environments, and how this determines dependency management strategies.

Understanding who controls what in the Python ecosystem is crucial for making effective architectural decisions and managing complex production environments. The approach bridges the gap between "script mentality" and "production software" mindset through understanding who controls what in the Python ecosystem stack.

## Key Concepts Covered

### Environment Control (CORE CONCEPT)
- **Minimal Control (Libraries)**: Must work in shared environments, use flexible version ranges
- **Partial Control (Frameworks)**: Manage plugin ecosystems, balance stability with extensibility  
- **Full Control (Applications)**: Own their environments, can pin exact versions for reproducibility
- Environment control level directly determines dependency management flexibility needs

### Application vs Framework vs Library Distinction (FOUNDATION)
- **Control Flow**: Libraries you call → Frameworks call you (IoC) → Applications run independently
- **Testing Responsibility**: Libraries (integration tests) → Frameworks (plugin compatibility) → Applications (end-to-end tests)
- **Reusability Requirements**: Libraries & Frameworks maximize reuse → Applications maximize specific functionality
- **Visual Architecture**: Mermaid diagrams showing containment and control relationships

### Dependency Management Strategy (PRACTICAL APPLICATION)
- Environment control drives version strategy: `numpy>=1.20,<2.0` vs `pandas==2.1.3`
- Testing responsibility explains why applications need strict version control
- This foundation enables understanding of the complete Python environment stack

### Environment Architecture Layers (ESTABLISHED IN SECTION 03)
- **6-Layer Stack**: Hardware → OS → System Packages → Runtime → Isolation → Dependencies & Config
- **Flexibility Strategies**: Libraries (🌐 Maximum) → Frameworks (🔸 Moderate) → Applications (🎯 Minimal)
- **Layer Separation Benefits**: Specialization, Change Frequency isolation, Shared Usage optimization
- **Tool Specialization**: Right tool for right layer prevents cross-layer anti-patterns
- **Docker Cross-Layer Warning**: Avoid using single tools to manage multiple layers

### Library vs Server Application Patterns (SECTIONS 05-06)
- **Libraries**: Maximum compatibility with flexible dependency ranges (`>=1.0,<2.0`), distributed via PyPI
- **Server Applications**: Conservative dependency ranges (`>=0.100,<0.200`), lock files for reproducibility, Docker deployment
- **Key architectural difference**: Libraries accommodate user environments, applications control their own environments
- **Tool workflow differences**: Libraries use `uv build` + `uv publish`, applications use `uv sync --frozen` + Docker images
- **Testing strategies**: Libraries need matrix testing across versions, applications test specific dependency stacks

### Tool Specialization and Performance (SECTIONS 04-06)
- **uv advantages**: 10-100x faster dependency resolution, single binary, integrated Python management
- **Tool combination patterns**: uv single tool, Docker + uv, Conda for scientific computing
- **Anti-patterns identified**: conda + uv causes package database conflicts and runtime crashes
- **Layer separation principle**: Right tool for right layer prevents architectural problems
- **Modern recommendations**: uv for Python dependencies, Docker for deployment, avoid tool mixing

## Presentation Development Process

The intended workflow is:
1. **First Phase**: Develop comprehensive MDC (markdown) content with focus on top-down architectural breakdown
2. **Second Phase**: Convert MDC content to Slidev presentation format

## Content Development Guidelines

When working with this repository:
- **Core Theme**: Environment control as the fundamental driver of dependency management decisions
- **Teaching Approach**: Shallow-to-deep progression suitable for presentation format
- **Visual Elements**: Mermaid diagrams showing control relationships, concise tables over lengthy explanations
- **Audience Consideration**: Bridge knowledge gaps between strong programming skills and packaging practices
- **Practical Focus**: Connect abstract concepts to real dependency management decisions
- **Production Mindset**: Transition from "script mentality" to understanding production software architecture
- **Foundation Building**: Section 02 (application-framework-library) establishes core concepts for all subsequent content

## Important Guidelines

- **Universal Applicability**: This presentation should be universally applicable to any organization or individual. Avoid company-specific references (e.g., "At Taboola", "for Taboola engineers"). Use generic terms like "modern software teams", "engineers", or "developers".

## Target Deliverable

- **Environment Control Fundamentals**: How libraries, frameworks, and applications control their execution environments differently
- **Dependency Strategy Logic**: Why environment control level determines version constraint flexibility (flexible ranges vs exact pins)
- **Testing Responsibility Architecture**: How different testing requirements drive dependency management decisions
- **Python Environment Stack**: Complete System → Python → Libraries → Dependencies management hierarchy
- **Production Tooling**: Modern ecosystem with performance considerations (uv, Ruff, conda limitations)
- **Enterprise Application**: Scale-dependent tool choices and practices for production environments

- **Visual preference**: Mermaid diagrams for flows, tables for comparisons, bullet points for concepts
- **Concise style**: Remove verbose explanations, consolidate redundant sections, use clear bullet points

## Java Comparison Guidelines (Added 2025-07-30)

**Purpose**: Help dual-audience presentation by providing context, not deep Java instruction

**Key Principles**:
- **Java content is CONTEXT only** - to help Java developers understand Python concepts better
- **Keep Java details minimal** - focus on high-level architectural differences, not tool deep-dives
- **Bidirectional benefit** - helps Java devs understand Python AND Python devs understand design differences
- **Avoid excessive detail** - Java ecosystem deep-dives detract from Python focus
- **Focus on "why Python needs different approaches"** - JVM abstraction vs explicit environment management

**Successful Pattern**:
```
Why Java doesn't need Python-style virtual environments:
1. JVM Abstraction vs Manual OS management
2. Classpath isolation vs Separate interpreters  
3. Integrated build tools vs Separate dependency tools
```

**Avoid**: Detailed Java tool comparisons, extensive Java workflow examples, Java-focused sections

## Editorial Style and Preferences (Added 2025-08-02)

**Content Organization Principles**:
- **Shallow-to-deep progression**: Start with high-level concepts before diving into details
- **Avoid redundancy**: Don't repeat explanations across sections; reference earlier sections instead
- **Presentation-friendly format**: Concise bullet points, clear tables, minimal verbosity
- **Practical examples**: Include concrete version ranges, command examples, and real scenarios

**Section Structure Preferences**:
- **Clear intro sections**: "What Makes a Good X" format with 4 key traits and concise bullet points
