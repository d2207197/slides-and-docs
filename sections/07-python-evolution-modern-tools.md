# The Python Packaging Renaissance: Modern Tools Era (2016-2024)

## The Awakening: Python Learns from Other Languages

After 15+ years of packaging pain, Python finally began adopting proven solutions from other ecosystems. This is the story of how Python went from the worst to matching the best.

## Phase 1: The Experiments (2016-2020)

### Pipenv (2016): Python's First Attempt at Modern Packaging

**The Promise**: Ruby's Bundler experience for Python
```bash
# The dream workflow
pipenv install requests
pipenv install --dev pytest
pipenv run python app.py
```

**What It Brought from Ruby**:
- `Pipfile` format (inspired by Gemfile)
- `Pipfile.lock` for reproducibility  
- Dev dependency separation
- Automatic virtualenv management

**Why It Failed**:
- Performance issues (very slow resolver)
- Maintainer burnout and abandonment
- Non-standard format (not PEP-compliant)
- But it proved Python developers wanted better!

### Poetry (2017): Learning from Rust's Cargo

**The Innovation**: All-in-one tool like Cargo
```toml
# pyproject.toml - Poetry's own format (pre-PEP 621)
[tool.poetry]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
requests = "^2.28.0"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0.0"
```

**Cargo-Inspired Features**:
- Single tool for everything: `poetry new`, `poetry add`, `poetry publish`
- Semantic versioning with `^` operator
- Built-in virtual environment management
- Dependency resolver that actually works

**Poetry's Impact**:
- Showed that Python developers wanted integrated tooling
- Pushed PEP standardization forward
- Still popular but struggled with standards compliance initially

## Phase 2: The Standardization Movement (2018-2022)

### The PEP Revolution: Building on Java's Standards Success

Python learned from Java that **standards enable ecosystem growth**.

| PEP | Year | What It Standardized | Inspired By |
|-----|------|---------------------|-------------|
| **PEP 517** | 2017 | Build backend hooks | Maven's build lifecycle |
| **PEP 518** | 2016 | pyproject.toml existence | Cargo.toml, package.json |
| **PEP 621** | 2020 | Project metadata | Maven POM structure |
| **PEP 660** | 2021 | Editable installs | npm link |

### PEP 518: The pyproject.toml Revolution

**Before** (setup.py complexity):
```python
from setuptools import setup
exec(open('mypackage/version.py').read())  # Complex and non-deterministic
setup(
    name='mypackage',
    version=__version__,  # From exec() above
    install_requires=parse_requirements('requirements.txt'),  # Custom function
)
```

**After** (declarative beauty):
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "mypackage"
version = "1.0.0"
dependencies = [
    "requests >= 2.28.0",
    "click >= 8.0",
]
```

### PEP 621: Learning from Maven's Project Object Model

**Maven's Influence** (2004):
```xml
<project>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <description>My application</description>
  <url>https://example.com</url>
  <licenses>...</licenses>
</project>
```

**Python's Response** (2020):
```toml
[project]
name = "my-app"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "My application"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
license = {text = "MIT"}
urls = {homepage = "https://example.com"}
```

## Phase 3: The Modern Tools Revolution (2020-2024)

### PDM: Python's npm-style Package Manager

**Innovation**: PEP 582 (local packages directory) like node_modules
```bash
pdm init
pdm add requests
pdm run python app.py
# No virtualenv needed!
```

### Hatch: The Integrated Development Environment

**Learning from**: Rust's cargo + Node's npm scripts
```toml
[tool.hatch.envs.test]
dependencies = ["pytest", "pytest-cov"]

[tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
run = "pytest {args}"
cov = "pytest --cov"
```

### Rye: Rust-Powered Python Toolchain

**Created by**: Armin Ronacher (Flask creator)
**Philosophy**: "Cargo, but for Python"
```bash
rye init
rye add requests
rye sync
rye run python app.py
```

## Phase 4: The Game Changer - uv (2023-2024)

### uv: When Python Finally Caught Up

**Built by**: Charlie Marsh (creator of Ruff)
**Written in**: Rust (for speed)
**Goal**: Be better than every other language's tooling

### Speed Comparison: The Rust Effect

| Operation | pip (2023) | poetry | conda | uv | Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|-----|-------------|
| Install NumPy | 12s | 15s | 45s | 0.2s | **60x faster** |
| Resolve deps | 30s | 25s | 2min | 0.5s | **60x faster** |
| Create env | 3s | 5s | 10s | 0.1s | **30x faster** |

### uv's Revolutionary Features

**1. Integrated Python Management** (like rustup):
```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv python list
uv venv --python 3.12
```

**2. Lightning Fast Resolution** (Rust-powered):
```bash
# Resolves entire scipy stack in <1 second
uv pip install scipy matplotlib pandas numpy
```

**3. Modern Workflow** (Cargo-inspired):
```bash
uv init myproject
cd myproject
uv add requests
uv add --dev pytest
uv run python app.py
uv build
uv publish
```

**4. Standards Compliant**:
- Uses standard `pyproject.toml`
- Generates standard lock files
- Compatible with pip

### How uv Learned from Everyone

| Feature | Learned From | Implementation |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Speed** | Rust/Cargo | Written in Rust |
| **Workflow** | Ruby/Bundler | `uv add` updates pyproject.toml |
| **Lock files** | npm/yarn | Automatic generation |
| **Python management** | rbenv/rustup | Built-in version management |
| **Workspaces** | npm/cargo | Monorepo support |
| **Scripts** | npm | `uv run` command |

## PEP 735 (2024): Dependency Groups - 14 Years Late but Worth It

### What Took So Long?

**Ruby (2010)**:
```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec'
end
```

**Python (2024)**:
```toml
[dependency-groups]
test = ["pytest", "pytest-cov"]
docs = ["sphinx", "furo"]
dev = [{include-group = "test"}, {include-group = "docs"}, "ruff"]
```

**Why the 14-year gap?**
1. Needed pyproject.toml standard first (2018)
2. Tools had their own solutions (poetry, pdm)
3. Required consensus across competing tools
4. But now it's standardized!

## The State of Python Packaging in 2025

### What Python Now Has (2025)

| Feature | Status | Tool Support | Comparable To |
|---------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Declarative config** | ✅ pyproject.toml | All modern tools | Cargo.toml |
| **Intelligent lock files** | ✅ Multiple formats | uv, poetry, pdm | Gemfile.lock |
| **Dependency groups** | ✅ PEP 735 | uv, poetry 2.0, pdm | Ruby groups |
| **Fast resolver** | ✅ Rust-powered | uv | Cargo speed |
| **Integrated tooling** | ✅ Multiple approaches | uv, poetry, pdm, hatch | Almost Cargo |
| **Python management** | ✅ Built-in | uv, rye | rustup |
| **Environment management** | ✅ Advanced features | hatch (matrix testing), all others | Various approaches |
| **Standards foundation** | ✅ Strong PEPs | All tools | Java's Maven standards |

### Performance Revolution: Python Joins the Speed Race

**The Rust Effect on Python Tooling**:
- **Ruff**: 100x faster than flake8/black
- **uv**: 10-100x faster than pip
- **polars**: Faster than pandas
- Written in Rust, used by Python

### From 5+ Tools to 1: The Python Transformation

**Old Python Workflow (2015) - Required 6 separate tools**:
```bash
# 1. Python version management
pyenv install 3.8.10
pyenv local 3.8.10

# 2. Virtual environment
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Package installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Dependency freezing
pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt

# 5. Building packages
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# 6. Publishing
twine upload dist/*
```

**Modern Python Workflow (2024) - 1 integrated tool**:
```bash
# Initialize project
uv init myproject --python 3.12
cd myproject

# Add dependencies
uv add fastapi uvicorn
uv add --dev pytest ruff mypy

# Development
uv run --reload uvicorn app:main
uv run ruff check
uv run mypy .
uv run pytest

# Build and publish
uv build
uv publish
```

**Python finally achieved what Rust had from day one: integrated tooling!**

## Community Adoption: The Tipping Point

### Modern Python Tool Comparison (2025)

| Tool | Lock Files* | Dependency Groups | Python Management | Matrix Testing | Best For |
|------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| **uv** | ✅ uv.lock | ✅ PEP 735 | ✅ Built-in | ❌ | Speed, all-in-one |
| **poetry** | ✅ poetry.lock | ✅ PEP 735 (v2.0) | ❌ | ❌ | Mature, stable |
| **pdm** | ✅ pdm.lock | ✅ PEP 735 | ❌ | ❌ | Standards compliance |
| **hatch** | ❌ (plugins only) | ✅ Environments | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Advanced | Testing workflows |
| **pip** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Basic installs |

***Lock files are primarily for Applications, not Libraries/Frameworks***

**When you need lock files**:
- ✅ **Applications**: Web services, CLI tools, data pipelines - you control the environment
- ✅ **Development workflows**: Ensuring team consistency during development
- ❌ **Published libraries**: Don't include lock files in PyPI packages (conflicts with users' environments)

### Tool Usage Trends (2025)

| Tool | PyPI Packages | Trajectory | Community |
|------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **setuptools** | 50k+ | Legacy | Declining |
| **poetry** | 41k+ | Mature | Large |
| **hatch** | 8k+ | Growing | Medium |
| **uv** | New | Exponential | Rapidly growing |
| **pdm** | 1.3k+ | Steady | Small but dedicated |

- **Workflow**: ✅ Modern and integrated
- **Community**: ✅ Rapidly adopting

**The Bottom Line**: Python packaging is no longer broken. Modern tools like uv have learned from the best of other languages and delivered a world-class experience. The 15-year gap has been closed.

### For Taboola Engineers

**If you're starting a new Python project today**:
1. Use `uv` - it's the future
2. Use `pyproject.toml` - it's the standard
3. Use lock files - **for applications and development environments**
4. Use dependency groups - organize properly

**Remember**: 
- **Applications** → Use lock files for reproducible deployments
- **Libraries** → Use flexible version ranges, no lock files in published packages
- **Frameworks** → Balanced approach depending on plugin ecosystem needs

**Python packaging is finally solved.** 🎉
