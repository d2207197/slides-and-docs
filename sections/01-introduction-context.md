# Introduction & Context

## Why This Matters for Taboola

At Taboola, we have diverse teams:
- **Data Scientists & ML Engineers**: Strong Python skills, but may lack packaging experience
- **Backend Engineers**: Strong software engineering practices (Java), but new to Python ecosystem
- **Need**: Production-ready Python code that scales, maintains, and integrates well

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this presentation, you will understand:
- **Environment Control**: How different Python tool types (libraries, frameworks, applications) control their execution environments
- **Environment Architecture**: The 6-layer stack from hardware to dependencies and how each layer offers different control levels
- **Flexibility Strategies**: Why libraries maximize flexibility while applications minimize it, and how this drives dependency decisions
- **Layer Separation**: Benefits of using the right tool for the right layer, and problems when layers are mixed
- **Tool Specialization**: How to choose appropriate tools for each environment layer
- **Production Mindset**: Transition from "script mentality" to understanding production software architecture

## Core Presentation Theme

This presentation focuses on **environment control as the fundamental driver of Python dependency management**. Understanding who controls what in the Python ecosystem is crucial for making effective architectural decisions and managing complex production environments.
