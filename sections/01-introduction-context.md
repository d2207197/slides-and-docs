# Introduction & Context

## Why This Matters for Taboola

At Taboola, we have diverse teams:
- **Data Scientists & ML Engineers**: Strong Python skills, but may lack packaging experience
- **Backend Engineers**: Strong software engineering practices (Java), but new to Python ecosystem
- **Need**: Production-ready Python code that scales, maintains, and integrates well

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this presentation, you will understand:
- **Environment Control**: How different Python tool types (libraries, frameworks, applications) control their execution environments
- **Dependency Strategy**: Why environment control level determines dependency management flexibility
- **Testing Responsibility**: How testing requirements drive different version constraint strategies
- **Python Environment Stack**: How to manage the complete System → Python → Libraries → Dependencies hierarchy
- **Production Mindset**: Transition from "script mentality" to production software architecture

## Core Presentation Theme

This presentation focuses on **environment control as the fundamental driver of Python dependency management**. Understanding who controls what in the Python ecosystem is crucial for making effective architectural decisions and managing complex production environments.
