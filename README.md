# Slides and Docs

This repository contains public slides and documents written in Markdown or other open text formats. Currently, Markdown is our primary choice as it maximizes compatibility with modern development tools like Cursor and Claude Code, enabling seamless integration with generative AI tools while maintaining flexibility.

## Philosophy

Using open text formats (currently primarily Markdown) enables:
- **Tool Freedom**: Compatible with any editor or AI-assisted development environment
- **AI Integration**: Optimized for generative AI tools and automated content workflows
- **Future-Proof**: Open formats that won't lock you into specific tools
- **Version Control**: Perfect for collaborative development with git
- **Format Flexibility**: Not limited to Markdown - any open text format that serves the content best
