# Python Packaging & Production Best Practices - Sections

This guide has been split into focused sections covering Python packaging and production best practices. The content emphasizes **environment control as the fundamental driver of dependency management** in the Python ecosystem.

## Core Theme

Understanding who controls what in the Python ecosystem is crucial for making effective architectural decisions. This presentation bridges the gap between "script mentality" and "production software" mindset through understanding environment control principles.

## Table of Contents

### Foundational Concepts

1. **[Introduction & Context](01-introduction-context.md)**
   - Why this matters for modern development teams
   - Learning objectives
   - Target audiences (Data Scientists/ML Engineers & Backend Engineers)

2. **[Application vs Framework vs Library](02-application-framework-library.md)** ⭐ CORE SECTION
   - The fundamental distinction: Who controls the environment?
   - Environment control levels (No/Partial/Full)
   - Testing responsibility and dependency management implications
   - Visual architecture diagrams

3. **[Environment Architecture Layers](03-environment-architecture-layers.md)**
   - 6-layer environment stack (Hardware → OS → System → Runtime → Isolation → Dependencies)
   - Library/Framework/Application flexibility strategies per layer
   - Layer separation benefits and anti-patterns

### Practical Implementation

4. **[Python Environment Tools](04-python-environment-tools.md)**
   - Modern tool ecosystem with Java architectural comparisons
   - Tool specialization by environment layer
   - Performance considerations (uv 10-100x faster)
   - Anti-patterns to avoid (conda + uv conflicts)

5. **[Library Repository Structure](05-library-repository-structure.md)**
   - Modern Python library layout (src/ structure)
   - pyproject.toml design with build backends vs project managers
   - uv workflow for library development and publishing
   - Optional dependencies vs dependency-groups

6. **[Server Application Development](06-application-example-docker-uv.md)**
   - Complete FastAPI application with Docker deployment
   - Conservative dependency ranges and lock files
   - Multi-stage build optimization and layer separation
   - Development workflow and production parity

7. **[Module & Subpackage Design](07-module-subpackage-design.md)**
   - Good module characteristics and API control with __init__.py
   - Layered dependencies and avoiding circular imports
   - Safe optional dependency handling patterns
   - Anti-patterns: wildcard imports, deep nesting, side effects

### Historical Context

8. **[The Problems - Python's Packaging Pain Points](08-the-problems-python-packaging-pain-points.md)**
   - Five core problems that plagued Python packaging (2000-2016)
   - Multi-language comparison timeline showing Python's delays
   - Real-world pain points and developer horror stories
   - Technical examples of what went wrong

9. **[The Root Causes - Why Python Fell Behind & How It Caught Up](09-the-root-causes-why-python-fell-behind.md)**
   - Deep analysis of leadership, cultural, and technical barriers
   - Community fragmentation and framework philosophy impact
   - The perfect storm that enabled Python's renaissance (2017-2025)
   - Current challenges and future outlook

### Modern Tooling

10. **[Python Tools 2025: The Modern Developer's Arsenal](10-the-solutions-modern-python-tools.md)** ⭐ PRACTICAL GUIDE
    - Strategic tool selection framework and domain-specific stacks
    - Performance revolution: uv (10-100x faster), ruff (100x faster linting)
    - Security & compliance tools: bandit, pip-audit, SBOM generation
    - Python vs Java tooling differences for dual audience
    - Migration strategies and future trends (Rust-based tools)

## Navigation

Each section includes:
- **Environment Control Focus**: How the topic relates to the core theme
- **Learning Objectives**: What you'll understand after reading
- **Next/Previous Section**: Easy navigation between topics

## Key Takeaways

1. **Environment control** determines dependency management strategy
2. **Libraries** have minimal control → flexible version ranges
3. **Frameworks** have partial control → balance stability with extensibility
4. **Applications** have full control → pin exact versions
5. **Modern tools** (uv, ruff) offer 10-100x performance improvements
6. **Right tool for right layer** prevents architectural problems
7. **Domain-specific stacks** optimize for Library/API/Data Science/CLI/Enterprise needs
8. **Security integration** is essential for modern Python development
9. **Tool coordination** matters more than individual tool choice
