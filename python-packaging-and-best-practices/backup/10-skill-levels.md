# Skill Levels: From Beginner to Expert

Based on the [Scala levels article](https://conorfennell.github.io/scala-zen/articles/scala-level.html), here's a Python-specific adaptation:

### Application Developer Levels

```ascii
Level A1: Beginning Application Developer
├── Basic Python syntax and concepts
├── Simple scripts and data analysis
├── Using pip and requirements.txt
├── Basic testing with unittest
└── Running applications locally

Level A2: Intermediate Application Developer
├── Project structure and modules
├── Virtual environments (venv, poetry)
├── Configuration management
├── pytest and test-driven development
├── Code formatting (black) and linting
├── Basic type hints
└── Simple packaging with setup.py

Level A3: Expert Application Developer
├── Advanced testing (mocks, fixtures, parametrized)
├── Performance optimization and profiling
├── Async programming (asyncio, aiohttp)
├── Advanced type checking (mypy, protocols)
├── Security best practices
├── Monitoring and observability
├── Complex configuration and secrets management
└── Production deployment and scaling
```

### Library Developer Levels

```ascii
Level L1: Junior Library Developer
├── Package structure and __init__.py
├── Setup.py and basic metadata
├── Version management and semantic versioning
├── Basic documentation (docstrings, README)
├── Public vs private APIs (_ and __)
├── Simple dependency management
└── Basic backwards compatibility

Level L2: Senior Library Developer
├── Advanced packaging (pyproject.toml, build backends)
├── Complex dependency resolution
├── Plugin systems and entry points
├── Advanced testing strategies
├── Documentation generation (Sphinx)
├── Multiple Python version support
├── Performance optimization
└── API design patterns

Level L3: Expert Library Developer
├── Meta-programming and descriptors
├── Advanced type system usage (TypeVars, Protocols)
├── C extensions and performance optimization
├── Complex build systems and distribution
├── Security considerations and threat modeling
├── Cross-platform compatibility
├── Framework design and ecosystem building
└── Mentoring and architectural leadership
```

### Skill Progression Matrix

| Aspect | Beginner (A1/L1) | Intermediate (A2/L2) | Expert (A3/L3) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Dependencies** | requirements.txt | poetry/uv, lock files | Complex resolution, constraints |
| **Testing** | Basic unittest | pytest, coverage | Property-based, performance |
| **Types** | Optional hints | mypy compliance | Advanced generics, protocols |
| **Packaging** | setup.py | pyproject.toml | Custom build backends |
| **Documentation** | README, docstrings | Sphinx, examples | API design, tutorials |
